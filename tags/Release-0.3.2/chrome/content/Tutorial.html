				NRL Order It is a Firefox extension for creating, organizing, tracking, and 
				printing purchase orders for the NRL Chemistry Division Code 6100 procurement. 
				The extension is designed to easily create purchase orders by copying and pasting 
				from websites within the Firefox browser and provides functionality for maintaining 
				contact information for companies and job order numbers. NRL Order It does not provide 
				functionality for online submission of purchase orders to Procurement, but does provide 
				printing of purchase orders as a properly formatted hard copy for submission. Below is
				a brief tutorial for getting started with NRL Order It. Enjoy!
